Okay, that comes to a total

We'd better go over the

I recommend you take at
least 1 pounds of food
for each person in your
family. I see that you have
5 people in all. You'll need
flour, sugar, bacon, and
coffee. My price is 20
cents a pound.

Well then, you're ready
to start. Good luck!
You have a long and
difficult journey ahead
of you.

Don't forget, you'll need
oxen to pull your wagon

# 2. Learn about the trail

Try taking a journaey by
covered wagon across 2000
miles of plains, rivers, and
mountains. Try! On the 
plains, will you slosh
your
oxen through mud and
water-filled ruts or will you
plod through dust six inches
deep?

How will you cross the rivers?
If you have money, you might
take a ferry (if there is a
ferry). Or, you can ford the
river and hope you and your
wagon aren't swalloved alive!

What about supplies? Well, if
you're low on food you can
hunt. You might get a buffalo...
you might. And there are
bear in the mountains.

At the Dalles, you can try
navigating the Columbia River,
but if running the rapids with
a makeshift raft makes you
queasy, better take the Barlow 
Road.

If for some reason you don't
survive -- your wagon burns,
or thieves steal your oxen, or
you die of cholera -- don't
give up! Try again...and
again...until your name is up
with the others on The Oregon 
Top Ten
